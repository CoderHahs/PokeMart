# PokeMart

A marketplace for users to buy and sell everything related to Pokemon!

PokeMart was created using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). This was a tutorial project created by Mosh Hamedani which I followed to learn the framework and extended to suit my needs.
The main inspiration behind this app is the recent popularity of Pokemon cards and people collecting them. I thought it would be great to create a marketplace to help users that want to buy and sell Pokemon cards.

The backend of this app is hosted using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
